## Talk GraphX
This is the repository for the talk about GraphX held for the [Codemotion Milan](http://milan2015.codemotionworld.com/) conference. 
To compile and run, you have to create a scala project and add the jar 
    spark-assembly-1.5.1-hadoop2.6.0.jar
that you can find in the `lib` directory of Apache Spark v1.5.1 tarball.
To download the tarball, you have to go to [download page](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) of Apache Spark project and choose
  * Spark release: 1.5.1
  * Package type: Pre-built for Hadoop 2.6 and later
  * Download type: the one you prefer
  
Spark 1.5.1 uses Scala version 2.10, so you need to use a compatible Scala version (2.10.x).
